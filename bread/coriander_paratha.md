# Coriander stuffed paratha

## Ingredients

* 150 g plain flour
* 60 ml water
* 2 tbsp oil
* 0.75 tsp salt
* Large bunch fresh coriander
* 1 red chilli
* 2 tsp cumin
* 0.25 cup feta or paneer
* 1 clove garlic

## Method

1. Mix the flour, oil and salt together in a bowl.
2. Mix in more or less water bit by bit with a wooden spoon or paddle until the dough forms a cohesive, supple, non-sticky ball.
3. Knead on a lightly floured work surface until the dough isn't shaggy and sticky.
4. Rest the dough for at least 20 minutes.
5. Finely chop the coriander, chilli and garlic and combine in a bowl.
6. Add the cumin, crumble the feta into the bowl. Mix until combined.
7. Divide the dough into four and shape into balls.
8. Flatten the balls to form a thick disc.
9. Add a spoonful of the coriander mixture to the centre of each disc, then fold over the sides of the disc and crimp to cover the filling.
10. Roll the disc until thin.
11. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a shallow thin-bottomed pan until it is almost smoking.
12. Fry each bread until the bottom is browned with bubbles, then flip to cook the other side. Add more oil for each bread as needed.
13. Serve warm.
