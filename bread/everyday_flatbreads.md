# Everyday flatbreads

## Ingredients

* 150 g plain flour
* 60 ml water
* 2 tbsp oil
* 0.75 tsp salt

## Method

1. Mix the flour, oil and salt together in a bowl.
2. Mix in more or less water bit by bit with a wooden spoon or paddle until the dough forms a cohesive, supple, non-sticky ball.
3. Knead on a lightly floured work surface until the dough isn't shaggy and sticky..
4. Divide the dough into four and shape into balls.
5. Flatten the balls to form a disc.
6. Roll the balls out on a very lightly floured surface until they are about 1-2 mm thick.
7. Heat a shallow thin-bottomed pan until it is almost smoking.
8. Fry each bread until bubbles start to form on the surface, then flip and fry the other side until lightly browned, with darker patches where the bubbles are.
9. Stack the breads and possibly cover with a towel to steam them for a couple of minutes.
